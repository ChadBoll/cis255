						<p><b>TEDxSVSU 2015</b></p>
						<p>The 2015 page does't seem bad everything is readable. tried opening in different size creens and it wokred wihtout having to scroll around.  The site isn't super flashy which doesn't distract the user.  It also seems to have all the information in easily labeled areas.  Also the social media links are easy to find and ver accessable which is important now same with the page opening on all devices.  The colors arent overly bright or distracting and is easy to read. </p>
						
						<b>TEDxSVSU 2016</b></p>
						<p>The 2016 site is not user friendly on all devices. as we mentioned in class the with the top link saying the location is in a different tab.  They should just make that clickable and go right to the information instead of the user having to look at it.  I think there are way too many pictures the distract from the information and everything seems big and overwhelming to teh user. </p>
